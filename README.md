# T-Wars
First Semester Project - Video Game Dev Universitiy

T-Wars is an inspired battle tanks PVP arena.

Being this the first semester, the idea was to use pretty basic programing stuff and unity tools. Try a few if-else and basic Gameobjects and components. 

I really liked the idea of 2 players and created a PVP tank wars with timed upgrades that spawn overtime. Both player controllers are in the same script, we really weren't supposed to do something this complex. But it worked out ok and learned a lot.
